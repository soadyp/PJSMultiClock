WPF - Multiple Timezone clocks 
Welcome to the PJSMultiClock wiki! Please feel free to improve this simple tool.
It was built on a weekend after being asked for 57th time about the time in 3 time zones 
in the USA, Australia, Germany and England . Trying to schedule calls for tele conferences.
Problem solved. Donated to community in case some one finds this useful. 
PS: Im happy to transfer ownership if someone wants to seriously take the project on. 

Built in c# on VS2015 using basic WPF project. Only extra library used was the WPF extended toolkit for the time picker.
